# Stellar SDK for Scala

This is the SDK for performing [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) operations via Scala. It provides the ability to
access Stellar networks via Horizon instances to build and submit transactions, query the state of the network and
stream updates.

Scala developers may prefer to use this SDK because:

* it has a simple, Scala-centric API
* its operations are asynchronous by default
* it uses explicit type hierarchies instead of primitives
* it is tested to near 100% coverage with generative testing

The code throughout this documentation is compiled against Scala $scalaBinaryVersion$. (The library also supports
Scala 2.11).


## Quick-start

Add the SDK via your dependency management tool.

@@dependency[sbt,Maven,Gradle] {
  group="$organization$"
  artifact="$name$"
  version="$version$"
}

Creating an account on the public test network.

@@snip [SessionTestAccount.scala](../../it/scala/stellar/sdk/SessionTestAccount.scala) { #friendbot_example }

Fetching the details of an account.

@@snip [SequentialIntegrationSpec.scala](../../it/scala/stellar/sdk/SequentialIntegrationSpec.scala) { #account_details_example }

Submitting a payment.





## Deprecation warning

At this stage, some classes and interfaces are likely to be refined. Minor releases may break backwards compatibility
with minimal notice until v1.0.0.
